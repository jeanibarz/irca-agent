# IRCA-Agent

## Overview

IRCA-Agent is an innovative project aimed at generating specialized datasets and fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. Utilizing the guidance-ai library, this project focuses on constraining the LLM to produce specific outputs, catering to bespoke use cases and applications.

## Features

- **Dataset Generation**: Leveraging cutting-edge techniques to create rich, diverse datasets tailored for LLM training.
- **Fine-Tuning LLM**: Utilizing advanced models like Transformers, PEFT, and QLORA for the nuanced development of the LLM.
- **Guided AI Outputs**: Integration with the guidance-ai library to direct the LLM towards generating specific types of responses.
- **Data Labeling**: Employing Argilla, an open-source framework, for efficient and accurate dataset labeling.
- **API Deployment**: Offering a public API through FastAPI and OAuth2, enabling secure and scalable web-based inferences.
